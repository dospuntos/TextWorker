## Haiku Generic Makefile v2.6 ##

## Fill in this file to specify the project being created, and the referenced
## Makefile-Engine will do all of the hard work for you. This handles any
## architecture of Haiku.

# The name of the binary.
NAME = TextWorker
TARGET_DIR = .

# The type of binary, must be one of:
#	APP:	Application
#	SHARED:	Shared library or add-on
#	STATIC:	Static library archive
#	DRIVER: Kernel driver
TYPE = APP

# 	If you plan to use localization, specify the application's MIME signature.

#	The following lines tell Pe and Eddie where the SRCS, RDEFS, and RSRCS are
#	so that Pe and Eddie can fill them in for you.

#	Specify the source files to use. Full paths or paths relative to the
#	Makefile can be included. All files, regardless of directory, will have
#	their object files created in the common object directory. Note that this
#	means this Makefile will not work correctly if two source files with the
#	same name (source.c or source.cpp) are included from different directories.
#	Also note that spaces in folder names do not work well with this Makefile.

#	Specify libraries to link against.
#	There are two acceptable forms of library specifications:
#	-	if your library follows the naming pattern of libXXX.so or libXXX.a,
#		you can simply specify XXX for the library. (e.g. the entry for
#		"libtracker.so" would be "tracker")
#
#	-	for GCC-independent linking of standard C++ libraries, you can use
#		$(STDCPPLIBS) instead of the raw "stdc++[.r4] [supc++]" library names.
#
#	- 	if your library does not follow the standard library naming scheme,
#		you need to specify the path to the library and it's name.
#		(e.g. for mylib.a, specify "mylib.a" or "path/mylib.a")
LIBS =   be shared localestub tracker translation icuuc icui18n $(STDCPPLIBS)

#	Specify additional paths to directories following the standard libXXX.so
#	or libXXX.a naming scheme. You can specify full paths or paths relative
#	to the Makefile. The paths included are not parsed recursively, so
#	include all of the paths where libraries must be found. Directories where
#	source files were specified are	automatically included.

#	Additional paths to look for system headers. These use the form
#	"#include <header>". Directories that contain the files in SRCS are

#	#include "header". Directories that contain the files in SRCS are
#	automatically included.

#	Specify the level of optimization that you want. Specify either NONE (O0),
#	SOME (O1), FULL (O2), or leave blank (for the default optimization level).
OPTIMIZE := NONE

# 	Specify the codes for languages you are going to support in this
# 	application. The default "en" one must be provided too. "make catkeys"
# 	will recreate only the "locales/en.catkeys" file. Use it as a template
# 	for creating catkeys for other languages. All localization files must be
# 	placed in the "locales" subdirectory.
LOCALES = ca de en es_419 nb

#	Specify all the preprocessor symbols to be defined. The symbols will not
#	have their values set automatically; you must supply the value (if any) to
#	use. For example, setting DEFINES to "DEBUG=1" will cause the compiler
#	option "-DDEBUG=1" to be used. Setting DEFINES to "DEBUG" would pass
#	"-DDEBUG" on the compiler's command line.

#	Specify the warning level. Either NONE (suppress all warnings),

#	Specify any additional linker flags to be used.
LINKER_FLAGS =

#	(Only used when "TYPE" is "DRIVER"). Specify the desired driver install
#	location in the /dev hierarchy. Example:
#		DRIVER_PATH = video/usb
#	will instruct the "driverinstall" rule to place a symlink to your driver's
#	binary in ~/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/video/usb, so that your driver will
#	appear at /dev/video/usb when loaded. The default is "misc".
